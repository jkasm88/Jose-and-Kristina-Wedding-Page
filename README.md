# Jose and Kristina Wedding Page

This is my future wedding page for my family, friends and guests. The main page of the website covers the story of how my girlfriend and I met and displays pictures of us. The wedding information page has the details of where the ceremony and reception are and who is in the wedding party. The RSVP page allows my family and guest to RSVP to our wedding.
The website showcases what I've learned in the course and my coding skills.
 
## UX
 
The user is expected to find the love story of Jose and Kristina, details about the wedding, and how to RSVP.

## Features

- index.html - This is the intial page that users would see. There is a small background story of how Jose and Kristina met along with pictures of the couple.
- info.html - This is the second page that users would navigate to find out details about the wedding. You can find information about the ceremony/reception and about the bridal party. 
- rsvp.html - This is the third page that users would navigate to rsvp to the wedding and there is a link to the gift registry. 
 
### Strategy

My goal in the design was to provide information easily and make the site user-friendly.

### Scope

For family, friends, and users I wanted to provide information to the user about the couple, wedding information, and how to rsvp. 

### Structure

Each page is designed for a single purpose so that it is eye pleasing and user friendly. Each page has links to the couples social media and contact information in case the user has questions.

### Skeleton

[Wireframes]()

### Skeleton

The black/white/grey colorscheme was chosen to create a simple and modern look.

### Features Left to Implement
- Once the wedding is over, I would like to transform the site into a summary site of the wedding. It would incorporate a photo gallery to include wedding pictures, a thank you section from us to our guests who attended, and a section for guest to comment about the wedding.

## Technologies Used

1) HTML
2) CSS
3) Bootstrap 4.4.1
4) FancyBox 3.5.7
5) Popper JS 1.15.0
6) Font Awesome v5.0.10
7) Google Fonts

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
