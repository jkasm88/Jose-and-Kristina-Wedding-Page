# Jose and Kristina Wedding Page

This is my future wedding page for my family, friends and guests. The main page of the website covers the story of how my girlfriend and I met and displays pictures of us. The wedding information page has the details of where the ceremony and reception are and who is in the wedding party. The RSVP page allows my family and guest to RSVP to our wedding.
The website showcases what I've learned in the course and my coding skills.
 
## UX
 
The user is expected to find the love story of Jose and Kristina, details about the wedding, and how to RSVP.

## Features

- index.html - This is the intial page that users would see. There is a small background story of how Jose and Kristina met along with pictures of the couple.
- info.html - This is the second page that users would navigate to find out details about the wedding. You can find information about the ceremony/reception and about the bridal party. 
- rsvp.html - This is the third page that users would navigate to rsvp to the wedding and there is a link to the gift registry. 
 
### Strategy

My goal in the design was to provide information easily and make the site user-friendly.

### Scope

For family, friends, and users I wanted to provide information to the user about the couple, wedding information, and how to rsvp. 

### Structure

Each page is designed for a single purpose so that it is eye pleasing and user friendly. Each page has links to the couples social media and contact information in case the user has questions.

### Skeleton

### Skeleton

The black/white/grey colorscheme was chosen to create a simple and modern look.

### Features Left to Implement
- Once the wedding is over, I would like to transform the site into a summary site of the wedding. It would incorporate a photo gallery to include wedding pictures, a thank you section from us to our guests who attended, and a section for guest to comment about the wedding.

## Technologies Used

1) HTML
2) CSS
3) Bootstrap 4.4.1
4) FancyBox 3.5.7
5) Popper JS 1.15.0
6) Font Awesome v5.0.10
7) Google Fonts

## Testing

The main goal of the site was to provide our family, friends, and guests information about us, details about the wedding, and how to rsvp and to view the registry. 

Our story page -  The title of the page is below and reads "Jose & Kristina" to indicate to the user that this site is all about us. Below is a navigation bar to the other pages. Depending on which page your on, the nav link color will be black. Below, is the first paragraph story of us followed by 3 photos that can be clicked to be enlarged. The second paragraph follows along with 3 addtional pictures. I've added an rsvp button which is navigate the user to the rsvp page for quick access. In the footer, there is a contact information for any guests that have questions along with the social links for guest to view.

Details page - The title and  navigation bar is provided at the top. The section provide details about the the wedding ceremony and reception and google maps is embedded for directions. The next section has photos of the bridal party which users can click to enlarge. An rsvp button is provided to quick access to the rsvp page so users don't need to scroll to the top. At the bottom is the same contact and socials links provided in the main page.

RSVP page - The form allows users to rsvp themselves and their guest. They can also write a message to the couple. Name and email is required to submit, you'll receive a message that you are unable to submit if missing. Below is a link to the registry, once you click the gift icon it will open another browser tab to the registry.

Social links - All links will open a new tab and all have been manually tested to ensure they work.

The site was tested across multiple browsers (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer). The site was tested across multiple mobile and tablet devices.
