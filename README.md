User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 1 - Code Institute
Jose and Kristina Wedding Page

This is my future wedding page for my family, friends and guests. The main page of the website covers the story of how my girlfriend and I met and displays pictures of us. The wedding information page has the details of where the ceremony and reception are and who is in the wedding party. The RSVP page allows my family and guest to RSVP to our wedding.
The website showcases what I've learned in the course and my coding skills.

The user is expected to find the story of us, details about the wedding, and how to RSVP.
